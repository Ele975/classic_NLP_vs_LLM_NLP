# Comparative analysis of ER Diagram extraction techniques from natural language requirements: Traditional NLP vs. LLM NLP

## Abstract:
We investigate and analyze two different natural language processing approaches for the spe- cific purpose of extracting ER Diagrams: classic Natural Language Processing and Large Lan- guageModelNLP.ForclassicNLPamodelbasedonheuristicruleshasbeenimplemented,while for LLM NLP the application programming interface of the model Generative pre-trained trans- former (GPT) 4.0 has been used. The effectiveness of the two approaches has been evaluated using the metrics precision, recall, and F1 score. The results confirm that the large language model GPT 4.0 outperforms the classic method, demonstrating its potential advantages for ex- tracting ER diagrams from natural language requirements.
